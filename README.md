Cyrano is a Twitter bot that generates its own original poetry. He utilizes grammars in order to write his poems according to the rules of poetry. Right now, Cyrano specializes in haikus and blank verse poems in iambic pentameter.

You can find him on Twitter [@cyranobot](https://www.twitter.com/cyranobot).
